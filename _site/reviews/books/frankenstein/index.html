<h3>Review</h3>
<p>&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a timeless piece of literature that delves into the complexities of human nature and the ethical boundaries of scientific exploration. Shelley's narrative is both haunting and thought-provoking, weaving a tale that is as much about the monster as it is about the man who created him. The characters are richly developed, with Victor Frankenstein's obsessive ambition and the creature's poignant quest for acceptance and understanding standing out as central themes. The novel's gothic atmosphere and philosophical depth make it a compelling read that continues to resonate with readers today.</p>
<h3>Score</h3>
<p>5/5</p>
